# Superheroes Management App

This application allows users to manage a list of superheroes. Users can:

- **Add new superheroes**: Enter the superhero’s name, superpower, and humility score to add them to the list.
- **View the list of superheroes**: Display all superheroes in a table, showing their name, superpower, and humility score.
- **API Integration**: The app communicates with an API to fetch and add superheroes to a backend database.

The app is designed with a simple UI for managing superhero data and is built using React for the frontend. It interacts with a RESTful API that handles the creation and retrieval of superhero data.


# Collaboration on Superhero Task

## Plan

1. **Agree on API Contracts**
   - Both teammates align on the structure and behavior of API endpoints (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

2. **Split the Work**
   - **Backend Teammate:** Focus on developing new API endpoints like `UPDATE` and `DELETE`.
   - **Frontend Teammate:** Work on building UI screens and components, and implement the logic to consume the APIs.

3. **Collaboration**
   - Regularly sync up to review the API responses, ensure the frontend works with the API, and adjust where necessary.

## Communication
We'll stay in touch frequently, make use of version control (Git), and test the integration between the frontend and backend. 

# If I Had More Time

- **Update and Delete Functionalities**: I would implement the ability to update and delete superheroes in the API and UI. This would include adding logic for modifying existing superheroes and removing them from the list.

- **Superhero Details**: I could add more detailed information about each superhero, such as their origin story, weaknesses, and additional stats (e.g., power level, speed).

- **Villains**: To expand the concept, I could introduce a "Villain" feature, where users could create and manage villains, which would interact with superheroes in the app.

- **Animations**: I'd add animations for transitions and interactions (e.g., adding a superhero or updating a superhero’s information) to improve the user experience.

- **Weapons for Superheroes**: I could add a feature to equip superheroes with weapons or special items that influence their abilities, adding more depth and strategy to the superhero interactions.
